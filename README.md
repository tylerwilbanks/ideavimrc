# ideavimrc
my .ideavimrc file

If you don't already have an .ideavimrc file:
```
cp .ideavimrc ~/.ideavimrc
```
else copy the contents of this `.ideavimrc` into your `~/.ideavimrc`.

You will need to install the idea vim plugin in the jetbrains plugin store, and possibly restart your IDE.

If you already have the plugin and just copied the config file with your jetbrains IDE open, you'll need to close the IDE and reopen to reload the config changes.

side note: on my work mac I found `set multiple-cursors` at the bottom of the file, but my personal linux machine, I did not have this line and it worked fine. I added the line here and everything still seems to work fine!

Enjoy!
